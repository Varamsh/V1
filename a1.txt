As you know, I have been working as a Senior Engineer in the CT  since 7 years,During this period, I have worked hard sincerely and have been putting in my best efforts to perform at the desired level ultimately achieve the goal of the
Company. 
I would to kindly request you for at least a 30% hike in my salary, which will not only help me in meeting my expenses and help in saving for future but also will greatly keep self-motivated during the work for better performance.

I feel my request is reasonable and you would be kind enough to do the needful.
